CRASHD

Crash Diagnostics is a VMware supported open source tool which allows cluster operators to run commands on remote machines to retrieve logs and other resources when troubleshooting cluster issues. 
Learn more about the project here https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/crash-diagnostics.

During execution, Crash diagnostic loads, parses, and executes its command from a file known as the diagnostics file which is composed of commands to collect information and other diagnostics resources from specified machines then making tar file to send across.

Crash analyze loads, parses, and executes its command from a file known as the analyze file which is composed of commands to collect information and other analyze resources from specified machines then displaying in console/command line.

Common problems seen :

CPU, memory or disk exceptions
Kernel deadlock and filesystem damage
Container runtime daemon not responding
Unhealthy etcd
Request and limit blackbox
Pod failures
Certificates expiring
Service failures
OOM (Out of Memory)
Goal :
To enhance atomâ€™s infrastructure troubleshooting capabilities by bringing in tools which can collect output of different commands and logs which the team usually uses during manual troubleshooting scenarios , output of these logs and command will be archived and will be share by customers and will be used as upheld for final RCA.

Running the script

                  python crashd.py
This script will do below actions

Create directory to store result based on timestamp
Extract crashd binary
Copy crashd binary to executable part
Fetching master ips
Fetching all IPS
Run diagnostic script on all master and worker nodes
Run analyze script on master node
Result stored for diagnostic script in /home/atom/scripts/troubleshooting/report_<timeStamp>/result.tar.gz
Result displayed for analyze script on console/command line
